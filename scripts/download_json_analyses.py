download_json_analyses.py
------------------------
This script is intended to be run as a cron job on the HPC or other master 
data repository location. It downloads json files from the supplied S3 bucket
and directory, performs some basic validation, then copies well-formed files to
the active directory where Nick's data pipeline scans for new analysis requests.

It keeps a basic record of the analyses that have been submitted in a CSV file 
(eventually a database). It also limits the number of analyses that can be submitted
at once, but in the future we will have more validation and security checks.

It takes the location of the live directory for requests, the S3 prefix for the 
requests, and the local directory to download them to from environment variables or
sensible defaults, as seen below.
